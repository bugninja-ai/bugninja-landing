# ARTICLE TOPIC:
I want you to generate an article about Bugninja And selenium in which you compare our custom solution for AI based automated testing and it's advantages over selenium I want you to highlight features like self healing, and the fact that test managers and QA did not have to bother anymore with Test maintenance because we can detect if there is an update on the interface. You should also include that we do provide a playback function and that you can upload any sort of data like words, PDFs Excel gherkin to generate test case cases.
